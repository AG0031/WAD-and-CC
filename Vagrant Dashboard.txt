âœ… GOAL:
You want to place an index.html file inside your Vagrant Ubuntu VM and access it in your browser like this:

http://localhost:8080/index.html
STEP-BY-STEP IMPLEMENTATION

Step 1: Prepare your project folder (on Windows)
Create a folder:

C:\Users\YourName\Documents\VagrantProject
Inside that folder, create a file named index.html. Example content:

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>My College Dashboard</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Welcome to College Dashboard</h1>
</body>
</html>
Open PowerShell or Command Prompt, go into that folder:

cd "C:\Users\YourName\Documents\VagrantProject"
Initialize Vagrant:

vagrant init ubuntu/bionic64
Open the Vagrantfile and edit the networking section to add port forwarding:

config.vm.network "forwarded_port", guest: 80, host: 8080
Save the file and then start your VM:

vagrant up
Step 2: Set up Apache in Ubuntu VM
SSH into the VM:

vagrant ssh
Update packages:

sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y curl gnupg software-properties-common

Install Apache:

sudo apt install apache2 -y
Apache automatically runs after install. To confirm:

sudo systemctl status apache2
(Use q to quit the status output.)

Step 3: Copy the index.html from shared folder to Apache root
The folder where your Windows index.html is located is shared inside the VM at /vagrant.

From inside the VM, run:

sudo cp /vagrant/index.html /var/www/html/index.html
Set correct permissions (optional):

sudo chmod 644 /var/www/html/index.html

Step 4: Open it in your browser
On your Windows host, open a browser.

Go to:

http://localhost:8080/index.html
You should see:
